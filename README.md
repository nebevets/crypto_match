# Crypto-Match - Version 1.1

#### Description

> Crypto-Match is a memory matching game. The game board has 9 pairs of hidden cryptocurrency icons, selected at random. The player clicks two hidden "coins" to reveal the icons. If they match, the player is awarded an amount of the selected currency, based on their previous matching accuracy. If the icons do not match, they are hidden and the game continues. Once all the coins are matched, a final wallet amount is displayed, showing the total dollar amount of the coins awarded. While the game is being played, market prices of the coins fluctuate based on a simulated market exchange.
